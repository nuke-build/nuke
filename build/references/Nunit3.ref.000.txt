        
          The console interface runner is invoked by a command in the form
    NUNIT3-CONSOLE [inputfiles] [options]

where inputfiles is one or more assemblies or test projects of
a type that NUnit can process and options is zero or more options.
Input files and options may be mixed in any order.

Input Files
The console program must always have an assembly or project specified.
Assemblies are specified by file name or path, which may be absolute or
relative. Relative paths are interpreted based on the current directory.
In addition to assemblies, you may specify any project type that is
understood by NUnit. Out of the box, this includes various
Visual Studio project types as well as NUnit (.nunit) test projects (see
NUnit Test Projects for a description of NUnit test projects).
If the NUnit V2 framework driver is installed, test assemblies may
be run based on any version of the NUnit framework beginning with 2.0.
Without the V2 driver, only version 3.0 and higher tests may be run.

Options


@FILE
    Specifies the name (or path) of a FILE containing additional command-line arguments to be interpolated at the point where the @FILE expression appears. Each line in the file represents a separate command-line argument.



--test=NAMES
    Comma-separated list of NAMES of tests to run or explore. This option may be repeated. Note that this option is retained for backward compatibility. The --where option can now be used instead.


--testlist=FILE
    The name (or path) of a FILE containing a list of tests to run or explore, one per line.


--where=EXPRESSION
    An expression indicating which tests to run. It may specify test names, classes, methods, categories or properties comparing them to actual values with the operators ==, !=, =~ and !~. See Test Selection Language for a full description of the syntax.


--params|p=PARAMETER
    A test PARAMETER specified in the form NAME=VALUE. Multiple parameters may be specified, separated by semicolons or by repeating the --params option multiple times.


--config=NAME
    NAME of a project configuration to load (e.g.: Debug).


--process=PROCESS
    PROCESS isolation for test assemblies. Values: Single, Separate, Multiple. If not specified, defaults to Separate for a single assembly or Multiple for more than one. By default, processes are run in parallel.


--inprocess
    This option is a synonym for --process=Single


--agents=NUMBER
    NUMBER of agents that may be allowed to run simultaneously assuming you are not running inprocess. If not specified, all agent processes run tests at the same time, whatever the number of assemblies. This setting is used to control running your assemblies in parallel.


--domain=DOMAIN
    DOMAIN isolation for test assemblies.  Values: None, Single, Multiple. If not specified, defaults to Single for a single assembly or Multiple for more than one.


--framework=FRAMEWORK
    FRAMEWORK type/version to use for tests. Examples: mono, net-4.5, v4.0, 2.0, mono-4.0


--x86
    Run tests in a 32-bit process on 64-bit systems.


--dispose-runners
    Dispose each test runner after it has finished running its tests


--timeout=MILLISECONDS
    Set timeout for each test case in MILLISECONDS.


--seed=SEED
    Set the random SEED used to generate test cases.


--workers=NUMBER
    Specify the NUMBER of worker threads to be used in running tests. This setting is used to control running your tests in parallel and is used in conjunction with the Parallelizable Attribute. If not specified, workers defaults to the number of processors on the machine, or 2, whichever is greater.


--stoponerror
    Stop run immediately upon any test failure or error.


--skipnontestassemblies
    Skip any non-test assemblies specified, without error.


--debug
    Causes NUnit to break into the debugger immediately before it executes your tests. This is particularly useful when the tests are running in a separate process to which you would otherwise have to attach.


--debug-agent
    Available only in debug builds of NUnit, this option is for use by developers in debugging the nunit-agent itself. It breaks in the agent code immediately upon entry of the process.


--pause
    Causes NUnit to immediately open a message box, allowing you to attach a debugger. For cases where --debug does not work.


--wait
    Wait for input before closing console window.


--work=PATH
    PATH of the directory to use for output files.


--output, --out=PATH
    File PATH to contain text output from the tests.


--err=PATH
    File PATH to contain error output from the tests.


--result=SPEC
    An output SPEC for saving the test results. This option may be repeated.


--explore[=SPEC]
    Display or save test info rather than running tests. Optionally provide an output SPEC for saving the test info. This option may be repeated.


--noresult
    Don't save any test results.


--trace=LEVEL
   Set internal trace LEVEL. Values: Off, Error, Warning, Info, Verbose (Debug)


--labels=VALUE
    Specify whether to write test case names to the output. Values: Off, On, All


--test-name-format=VALUE
    Specify a non-standard naming pattern to use when generating all test names. See Template Based Test Naming.


--encoding=CODEPAGE
    Specify the Console CODEPAGE, such as utf-8, ascii, etc. This option is not normally needed unless your output includes special characters. The page specified must be available on the system.


--shadowcopy
    Tells .NET to copy loaded assemblies to the shadowcopy directory.


--teamcity
    Turns on use of TeamCity service messages.


--loaduserprofile
    Causes the user profile to be loaded in any separate test processes.


--list-extensions
    Lists all extension points and the extensions installed on each of them.


--set-principal-policy=POLICY
    Set the principal policy for the test domain to POLICY. Values: UnauthenticatedPrincipal, NoPrincipal, WindowsPrincipal


--noheader, --noh
    Suppress display of program information at start of run.


--nocolor, --noc
    Displays console output without color.


--help, -h
    Display this message and exit.



Description
By default, this command runs the tests contained in the
assemblies and projects specified. If the --explore option
is used, no tests are executed but a description of the tests
is saved in the specified or default format.
Several options that specify processing of XML output take
an output specification as a value. A SPEC may take one of
the following forms:

--OPTION:filename
--OPTION:filename;format=formatname
--OPTION:filename;transform=xsltfile

The --result option may use any of the following formats:

nunit3 - the native XML format for NUnit 3
nunit2 - legacy XML format used by earlier releases of NUnit

The --explore option may use any of the following formats:

nunit3 - the native XML format for NUnit 3
cases  - a text file listing the full names of all test cases.

If --explore is used without any specification following, a list of
test cases is output to the console.
If neither --result nor --explore is used,
NUnit saves the results to TestResult.xml in nunit3 format.
Any transforms provided must handle input in the native nunit3 format.
