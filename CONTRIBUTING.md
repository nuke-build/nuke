# Contribution Guidelines

NUKE is a personal project that was made open-source to let as many individuals as possible have a benefit from it. We expect everyone to be a [good open-source citizen](https://hackernoon.com/being-a-good-open-source-citizen-9060d0ab9732) and to realize that this is [not a place to make demands or express disappointment](https://mikemcquaid.com/2018/03/19/open-source-maintainers-owe-you-nothing/). As a community, we want to help each other, provide constructive feedback, and make a better product. Of course, our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) must be followed at any time.

## Filing issues

All issues should be filed on the [main repository](https://github.com/nuke-build/nuke/issues/new/choose). When creating an issue, please follow this list:

1. Have you read the [documentation](https://nuke.build/docs/getting-started/philosophy.html)?
2. Have you checked the [FAQ](https://nuke.build/docs/getting-started/faq.html)?
3. Did you include the snippet of broken code in the issue?
4. Did you verify it's not an external tool issue?
5. What are the exact steps to reproduce this problem?
6. No issues for additional CLT support or missing arguments. We expect pull-request instead as they can be easily declared using a [specification file](https://github.com/nuke-build/nuke/tree/develop/build/specifications), and otherwise aren't affecting the core functionality.

GitHub supports [markdown](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/), so when filing issues make sure you check the formatting before clicking submit.

## Contributing code and content

For non-trivial changes it is strongly recommended to get in touch with the team first. Before starting with a [pull-request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests), please create a feature branch off from the default branch. Get familiar with the project workflow and our coding conventions.

Before submitting a feature or substantial code contribution please discuss it with the team and ensure it follows the product roadmap. Here's a list of blog posts that are worth reading before doing a pull request:
