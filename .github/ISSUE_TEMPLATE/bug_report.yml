      value: "***Important:** To create a bug report, you must be an active supporter of our community, i.e., a sponsor of NUKE on [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/matkoch)/[OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/nuke), a frequent blogger/mentor, or greatly involved in any other recognized OSS project. High-impact bugs may be reported at any time. Please don't take offense at this, particularly when an issue is closed with reference to this text. It is simply a time management decision. Also note, that unless being a bronze/silver/gold sponsor, there is no guarantee as of when an issue or pull-request will be acknowledged or resolved.*"
