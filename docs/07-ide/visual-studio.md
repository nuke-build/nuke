In [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) you can install the _NUKE Support extension_ to be more productive in writing, running, and debugging your builds.

From the _Task Runner Explorer_, you can double-click a target to run it. Additionally, you can use toggle buttons to attach the debugger or skip dependencies:
