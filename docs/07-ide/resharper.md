In [ReSharper](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper) you can install the _NUKE Support extension_ to be more productive in writing, running, and debugging your builds.

You can click the gutter icon next to your targets or hit <kbd>Alt</kbd>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<kbd>Enter</kbd> from inside their declaration to run and debug them. The top-level item starts a normal execution including all dependencies. From the submenu, you can debug and run/debug without dependencies:

![ReSharper](resharper-light.webp#gh-light-mode-only)
![ReSharper](resharper-dark.webp#gh-dark-mode-only)
