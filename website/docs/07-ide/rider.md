In [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider) you can install the [NUKE Support plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10803-nuke-support) to be more productive in writing, running, and debugging your builds.

You can click the gutter icon next to your targets or hit <kbd>Alt</kbd>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<kbd>Enter</kbd> from inside their declaration to run and debug them. The top-level item starts a normal execution including all dependencies. From the submenu, you can debug and run/debug without dependencies:
