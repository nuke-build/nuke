title: Adding NuGet Packages
---

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

In many cases, build automation relies on third-party tools. NUKE provides you with a great [API for working with CLI tools](../03-common/08-cli-tools.md), however, it is the responsibility of a build project to reference these tools in the form of NuGet packages and define their exact versions.

You can add a NuGet package to a build project by calling:

```cmd
nuke :add-package <package-id> [--version <package-version>]
```

:::info
When no version is provided, the latest version will be used. The major benefit compared to the `dotnet add package` command is that NUKE will automatically determine if the package should be referenced through `PackageReference`, i.e. as a normal library, or through `PackageDownload`, i.e. [without affecting the dependency resolution graph](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/wiki/%5BSpec%5D-PackageDownload-support#solution):

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="package-reference" label="PackageReference" default>

```xml title="_build.csproj"
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="<package-id>" Version="<package-version>" />
  </ItemGroup>

</Project>
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="package-download" label="PackageDownload" default>

```xml title="_build.csproj"
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageDownload Include="<package-id>" Version="[<package-version>]" />
  </ItemGroup>

</Project>
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## NuGet.org Instruction Tab

If you're browsing NuGet packages on [NuGet.org](https://nuget.org), you can also use the dedicated instruction tab to quickly copy the `add-package` command for the respective tool and version (only for global tools):

:::tip
When you're using a CLI task that depends on a NuGet package that is not yet installed, for instance `coverlet.console`, you will receive an error message with the appropriate `add-package` command:

```text
Missing package reference/download.
Run one of the following commands to install the package:
  - nuke :add-package coverlet.console --version 3.1.0
```
