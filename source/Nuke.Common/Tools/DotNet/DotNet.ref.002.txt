Description
The dotnet restore command uses NuGet to restore dependencies as well as project-specific tools that are specified in the project file. By default, the restoration of dependencies and tools are performed in parallel.
In order to restore the dependencies, NuGet needs the feeds where the packages are located. Feeds are usually provided via the NuGet.config configuration file. A default configuration file is provided when the CLI tools are installed. You specify additional feeds by creating your own NuGet.config file in the project directory. You also specify additional feeds per invocation at a command prompt.
For dependencies, you specify where the restored packages are placed during the restore operation using the --packages argument. If not specified, the default NuGet package cache is used, which is found in the .nuget/packages directory in the user&#39;s home directory on all operating systems (for example, /home/user1 on Linux or C:\Users\user1 on Windows).
For project-specific tooling, dotnet restore first restores the package in which the tool is packed, and then proceeds to restore the tool&#39;s dependencies as specified in its project file.
The behavior of the dotnet restore command is affected by some of the settings in the Nuget.Config file, if present. For example, setting the globalPackagesFolder in NuGet.Config places the restored NuGet packages in the specified folder. This is an alternative to specifying the --packages option on the dotnet restore command. For more information, see the NuGet.Config reference.
Arguments
ROOT
Optional path to the project file to restore.
Options



.NET Core 2.x


.NET Core 1.x



--configfile &lt;FILE&gt;
The NuGet configuration file (NuGet.config) to use for the restore operation.
--disable-parallel
Disables restoring multiple projects in parallel.
--force
Forces all dependencies to be resolved even if the last restore was successful. This is equivalent to deleting the project.assets.json file.
-h|--help
Prints out a short help for the command.
--ignore-failed-sources
Only warn about failed sources if there are packages meeting the version requirement.
--no-cache
Specifies to not cache packages and HTTP requests.
--no-dependencies
When restoring a project with project-to-project (P2P) references, restores the root project and not the references.
--packages &lt;PACKAGES_DIRECTORY&gt;
Specifies the directory for restored packages.
-r|--runtime &lt;RUNTIME_IDENTIFIER&gt;
Specifies a runtime for the package restore. This is used to restore packages for runtimes not explicitly listed in the &lt;RuntimeIdentifiers&gt; tag in the .csproj file. For a list of Runtime Identifiers (RIDs), see the RID catalog. Provide multiple RIDs by specifying this option multiple times.
-s|--source &lt;SOURCE&gt;
Specifies a NuGet package source to use during the restore operation. This overrides all of the sources specified in the NuGet.config file(s). Multiple sources can be provided by specifying this option multiple times.
--verbosity &lt;LEVEL&gt;
Sets the verbosity level of the command. Allowed values are q[uiet], m[inimal], n[ormal], d[etailed], and diag[nostic].

--packages &lt;PACKAGES_DIRECTORY&gt;
Specifies the directory for restored packages.
-r|--runtime &lt;RUNTIME_IDENTIFIER&gt;
Specifies a runtime for the package restore. This is used to restore packages for runtimes not explicitly listed in the &lt;RuntimeIdentifiers&gt; tag in the .csproj file. For a list of Runtime Identifiers (RIDs), see the RID catalog. Provide multiple RIDs by specifying this option multiple times.
-s|--source &lt;SOURCE&gt;
Specifies a NuGet package source to use during the restore operation. This overrides all of the sources specified in the NuGet.config file(s). Multiple sources can be provided by specifying this option multiple times.
--verbosity &lt;LEVEL&gt;
Sets the verbosity level of the command. Allowed values are q[uiet], m[inimal], n[ormal], d[etailed], and diag[nostic].
Examples
Restore dependencies and tools for the project in the current directory:
dotnet restore
Restore dependencies and tools for the app1 project found in the given path:
dotnet restore ~/projects/app1/app1.csproj
Restore the dependencies and tools for the project in the current directory using the file path provided as the source:
dotnet restore -s c:\packages\mypackages
Restore the dependencies and tools for the project in the current directory using the two file paths provided as sources:
dotnet restore -s c:\packages\mypackages -s c:\packages\myotherpackages
Restore dependencies and tools for the project in the current directory and shows only minimal output:
dotnet restore --verbosity minimal
