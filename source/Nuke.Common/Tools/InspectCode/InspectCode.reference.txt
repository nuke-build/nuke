dupFinderReferenceInspectCode Command-Line Tool        One of ReSharper?s most notable features,        code inspection, is available even without opening Visual Studio.        InspectCode, a        free command line tool        requires a minimum of one parameter- your solution file-        to apply all of ReSharper?s inspections.        To use InspectCode, you need to download        ReSharper Command Line Tools,        unzip the command line tools package, and then run:    InspectCode.exe &lt;SolutionFile.sln&gt; -o=&lt;PathToOutputFile&gt;                    If you are using InspectCode            to find code issues in C++, use            inspectcode.x86.exe, and do not use            inspectcode.exe.                                        Please ensure that the downloaded                .zip                file is 'unblocked' before extracting: right click on the file, select                Properties                and click                Unblock.                Failure to do this will cause the.NET framework to load the application in partial trust,                which means it won't load or run correctly.                    In this topic:Understanding outputUsage scenariosConfiguring InspectCodeUsing ReSharper settingsUsing command-line parametersSupported languagesUnderstanding output                    Execution of InspectCode results in an XML file with code issues found within the specified scope            (the whole solution or particular projects). The XML comprises two parts:                                The list of found issue types where each type corresponds to a specific inspection and has the following                attributes:                                        Id - allows linking each issue to the corresponding inspection.                                            Category - can be used to group similar issues by                        categories.                                            SubCategory - if some issue types have the same SubCategory attribute, it means that the issues                        are same, but found in different languages or different scopes.                        You can use it for further grouping.                                            Description - describes the problem                                            Severity - shows the                        severity level                        of the inspection.                                            WikiUrl - a link to the corresponding                        Code Inspection Index                        entry where available.                                            Global - notifies a                                                    solution-wide code inspection.                                                The list of found issues grouped by projects, where each issue has the following attributes:                                        TypeId - allows linking each issue to the corresponding inspection                        (                        IssueType                        in the first part of the report)                                            File - path to the affected file, relative to the solution.                                            Offset - offset range in symbols from the beginning of the file                        to the beginning and the end of the problematic code.                                            Line - the line that contains problematic code.                                            Message - a short description of the problem.                                            Severity - this attribute only appears if the                        severity                        of the issue differs from the severity of the corresponding inspection.                        This is possible if some projects within the solution have the 'Treat warnings as errors'                        option enabled and others do not- in this case some issues would have the 'Error' severity,                        which differs from the original 'Warning' severity.                                                    How the output should be processed is up to you. But here are a couple of recommended next steps:            transform the output to an HTML report, or generate some messages on your continuous integration (CI)            server based on number and types of detected issues.            Usage scenarios                    Now let?s see how we can use the tool and what exactly we can do with its output.            It may be helpful to run it on your local machine, but only if you don?t have ReSharper,            because with ReSharper you can                            get inspection results for a selected scope                        with a couple of clicks and, if necessary,                            export detected issues to a report file.            Also, with ReSharper you can            open InspectCode reports.                            A more promising case is to use InspectCode on a CI server where you can integrate it in the build script            and add code inspection results to your build reports and messages.                            The            JetBrains TeamCity            has created the following            visual presentation of the code issues detected by InspectCode:                                    To learn more, refer to the            TeamCity documentation            or            download the latest version of TeamCity            to try it out.            Configuring InspectCode        Using ReSharper settings                            If you have previously worked on the target solution with ReSharper, you may have already                configured code inspections settings.                If so, InspectCode will find your                custom settings                in                .DotSettings                files and apply them.                If there are no settings files, then the default severity levels will be used for all inspections.                Besides custom severity levels for code inspections, InspectCode will look for the following settings in                .DotSettings                files:                                            Whether the                                            solution-wide analysis                                        is enabled (this can be configured either in                    .DoSettings                    files or with the                    --swea/--no-swea                    parameters)                                    Naming rules                    (this can only be configured with                    .DoSettings                    files)                                                            Files, folders, and file masks excluded from code analysis                                        (this can only be configured with                    .DoSettings                    files)                                                            Files, file masks, and regions with generated code, where the code analysis is partly disabled                                        (this can only be configured with                    .DoSettings                    files)                                    A place where the code analysis engine should store caches.                    You can specify it on the                    Environment | General                    page of ReSharper options or with the                    --caches-home command-line parameter.                                            If you want to configure InspectCode on a CI server, you can make all configurations locally with                ReSharper,                                    save the settings to the Solution Team-Shared layer, and then commit the resulting                SolutonName.sln.DotSettings                file in the solution directory to your VCS.                InspectCode on the server will find and apply these settings.                                        As an alternative, you can specify a path to a shared                .DotSettings                file (which will override settings in other settings files, if any) through the                --profile                parameter.                            Using command-line parameters                            We have already mentioned some optional parameters above.                Among other optional parameters (which you can list by typing                InspectCode.exe--help) the following may come in handy:                                        --output                (-o)- lets you set the output file.                                                                                                    --project - allows analyzing particular project(s) instead of the whole solution.                    After this parameter,                    you can type a project name or a wildcard that matches several projects within your solution.                    For example,                    --project=*Billing                                    --disable-settings-layers                    (-dsl)- disables specified                    settings layers.                    Accepted values:                    GlobalAll,                    GlobalPerProduct,                    SolutionShared,                    SolutionPersonal,                    ProjectShared,                    ProjectPersonal                    (note that the per-project settings are not available in the ReSharper GUI.                    To create a per-project settings file,                    you can save your settings as a solution-shared and then rename the settings file to the                    YourProject.csproj.DotSettings)                                    --no-buildin-settings - suppresses global, solution and project settings profile usage.                    Equivalent to using                    --disable-settings-layers: GlobalAll; GlobalPerProduct; SolutionShared; SolutionPersonal; ProjectShared; ProjectPersonal                                    --caches-home - lets you specify a custom location for the data that InspectCode caches.                    By default, the                    %LOCALAPPDATA% directory is used, unless there are settings files,                    in which case the one specified there is used.                    This parameter can be helpful if you want to use a fast SSD disk for the cache or if you want                    to store all your build processing data in a single place.                                    --eXtensions                    (-x)                    ? allows using ReSharper extensions that affect code analysis. To use an extension, specify                    its ID, which you can find by opening the extension package page in the                    ReSharper Gallery, and then the                    Package Statistics page. Multiple values are separated with the semicolon.                                --properties                ? lets you override MSBuild properties. You can set each property separately                (--properties:prop1=val1                --properties:prop2=val2), or use a semicolon to separate multiple properties                (--properties:prop1=val1;prop2=val2).                The specified properties are applied to all analyzed projects.                Currently, there is no direct way to set a property to a specific project only.                The workaround is to create a custom property in this project and assign it                to the desired property, then use the custom property in dupFinder parameters.                                --dumpIssuesTypes                    (-it)- use this option to dump all existing                    code inspections to the                    output.                    This option should be used separately from actual analysis, i.e. without the solution argument.                                --config-create                and                --config                ? these options allow you to pass the parameters described above with a configuration file.                The first option will create a configuration file according to the current parameters;                the second option is used to load the parameters from this file.                                --toolset                    ? explicitly specified MsBuild Toolset version (12.0, 14.0, 15.0). For example,                    --toolset=12.0.                                            Here is an example of running InspectCode with a few command-line options:                        InspectCode.exe --project=Documents -o=&quot;C:\temp\Results.xml&quot; --no-swea -x=EtherealCode.ReSpeller &quot;C:\Projects\ReSharper\resharper.sln&quot;            Supported languages                    InspectCode finds code issues in the following languages:                                                C#                                                            VB.NET                                                            C++                                                            HTML                                                            ASPX                                                            Razor                                                            JavaScript                                                            TypeScript                                                            CSS                                                            XML                                                            XAML                                                            RESX                                                            Build Scripts                                                            Protobuf                                                            JSON                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Last modified: 31 May 2017
